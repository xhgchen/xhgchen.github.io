A year ago, I faced the largest predicament of my education so far: I
had finally found the discipline truest to my interests, but it was not my
area of study. I had been fortunate enough to lead the computational side of
our research on the protein cancer target Hsp90 at the
[Spyracopoulos Lab](https://lspy.biochem.ualberta.ca),
and it left me longing for a deeper understanding of the workings and design
of distributed systems, multithreaded applications, and distributed programs.
I thoroughly enjoyed the computational chemistry and biophysics, but I wanted
a deeper technical foundation â€“ one that I could rely on to build scalable
software in any industry. And so,
**I made the difficult decision to pursue another degree in
computer science (CS).**

I missed the problem solving I did in high school math competitions, and
I wanted more robust technical skills that I could apply broadly to my life.
The computational research helped me realize that I enjoyed
focused problem solving, testing, and troubleshooting with technology
far more than hands-on lab work. I will carry my appreciation for research
into my CS studies. I am looking forward to trying various CS subfields
such as distributed systems, artificial intelligence and
machine learning (AI/ML), and cybersecurity while remaining open to
further opportunities in computational biology.

After a season of applications, administrative errands, and CS learning,
I am more excited than ever to begin my studies this fall at the
[University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/).
I am happy to be spending this summer as a
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
contributor with
[MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/),
and I hope you enjoy following along on this blog.
