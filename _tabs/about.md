I find large-scale computer systems fascinating. In my computational research,
I leveraged high-performance computing on the
[Digital Research Alliance's clusters](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/national-services/clusters)
to simulate the protein cancer target Hsp90 via molecular dynamics (MD).
Running the MD software suite AMBER introduced me to these systems, but I felt
a deeper curiosity towards the workings and design of distributed systems,
multithreaded applications, and distributed programs. **This curiosity inspired
me to make a sharp career pivot into computer science.**

I will begin studying computer science at the
[University of British Colubmia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/) in September 2023.
I recently earned a Bachelor of Science with Honors in biochemistry from the
[University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) and graduated
with highest distinction.
I am currently working on implementing transport property analyses
in [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)
for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
My areas of interest are distributed systems, high-performance computing,
computational biology, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML),
and cybersecurity.

## Research

I took charge of the MD side of our research on the molecular mechanism of
the protein cancer target Hsp90 at the
[Spyracopoulos Lab](https://lspy.biochem.ualberta.ca).
I constructed 5 atomic models in PyMOL and conducted extensive classical
and steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using AMBER for
5 protein mutants: apo and ATP-bound Hsp90 S3CYF N-domains,
apo and ATP-bound Hsp90 S3CYF/F6D/F8D N-domains,
and intact, ATP-bound Hsp90 S3CYF
to investigate the energetic cost of strap release.
To validate our experimental NMR data, I calculated predicted parameters
from MD data using CPPTRAJ. I also trained 2 undergraduates in computational chemistry.

Our manuscript blending computational MD and experimental NMR was recently
submitted, and I will be sure to write an update here when the time comes.
